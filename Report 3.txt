The 8 requirements we chose are:

1.  Surface Shader - Transparent shader
        Used to make a clear marking of the out of bounds while playing the game
        You can find the material by (Materials, Transparentoutofbounds)
        You can find Shader by (Shaders, Transparent Shader)
        You can find it in the hierarchy by (Terrain, Outofbounds shader)

2.  Surface Shader - Shader with a vertex function
        used to make a flame effect for the bombs
        You can find the material by (Materials, bomb flame)
        You can find Shader by (Shaders, bomb shader)
        You can find it in the hierarchy by (BombSpawn, Inspector- Bomb Prefab)
    
3.  Surface Shader - Shader with a normal map
        used to make the bomb texture look bumpy and not smooth
        You can find the material by (Materials, Normal - bomb)
        You can find Shader by (Shaders, Normal Map Shader)
        You can find it in the hierarchy by ((BombSpawn, Inspector- Bomb Prefab)
        

4.  At least 3 Post Processing Effects with the Post Processing Stack
        used to make the screen depth of field go in and out
        used to change the screen color grading and auto exposure as well
        You can find the Post-processing Profile in assets
        You can find the Post-process layer in hierarchy-(Player, Main Camera)
        You can find the Post-process volume in hierarchy-(processing)
        You can find script in (Scripts, Vignettepost)
    
5.  Shader developed with Shader Graph
        Used to make sky effect. Effects include shadow variation and lightning style effect.
        Shader asset:   Shaders/SkyShader.shadergraph
        Material asset: Materials/SkyMaterial.mat
    
6.  Vertex and Fragment Shader 
        Used to make watermelon shift color when viewed at different angles. To see effect, run
        around watermelon. It will shift from the default red to a more magenta look as you rotate
        around it.
        Shader asset:   Shaders/WatermelonShaderVF.shader
        Material asset: Materials/WatermelonMaterial.mat
        Prefab asset:   Prefabs/Watermelon.prefab
    
7.  Animated Shader
        Used to make bananas "wiggle". The vertices are moved left and right to give an animated 
        wiggle-like movement effect.
        Shader asset:    Shaders/BananaAnimatedShader.shadergraph
        Material assets: Materials/BananaShaderYellow.mat
                         Materials/BananaShaderBrown.mat
        Prefab asset:    Prefabs/Banana.prefab

8.  Vertex and Fragment Shader with Grab Pass
        Used to make a "dash" effect. When running forwards or backwards, the ground in line with 
        the player is blurred using a grab pass. This effect is hidden when at a stand still or moving
        sideways only.
        Shader asset:   Shaders/RunBlurShader.shader
        Material asset: Materials/RunBlurMaterial.mat
        Prefab asset:   Prefabs/DashEffectQuad.prefab
        Modified script CharacterMovement.cs to activate/deactivate the DashEffectQuad

The 7 requirements we chose are:
1.  Gizmos 
        Used in Gizmos Folder, 2 scripts and a png image, 
        Used to mark playing boundry and a bomb icon where the bomb spawns above the player
        Hierarchy - (Terrain,OuterBoundries,Gizmos) and (Player,BombSpawn,Gizmos) 
        
2.  Unity Attributes
        Used in Playerlook.cs,CharacterMovment.cs, Timer.cs
        Used to make the mouse sentitvity and player speed to have a range it could be 
        Made Header for timer in the inspector
        Used require component for chracater movement.cs to always have a chracter controller
        Hierarchy - (Player) and (Player,Main Camera) and (Canvas, Timer)
    
3.  IMGUI Custom Inspector
        All Used in BombSpawn(Interval IMGUI) Folder in scripts folder
        Used to have buttons for the interval the bomb spawns during the game
        Hierarchy - (Player, BombSpawn)

4. IMGUI Property Drawer
        All used in IMGUI Property Drawer Folder in scripts folder
        Used to make a drop down property for the timer for the game
        Hierarchy - (Canvas, Timer)
    
5. UI Toolkit Custom Inspector 
        Used on AudioManager to show audio type groups. The script, AudioManagerEditor.cs provides
        the custom inspector script to divide the audio sources and clips into related groups. The custom
        inspector allows you to play the audio within the editor (non-runtime). The cleanup button allows
        you to manually cleanup (delete) the EditorAudio object (if not cleaned up, it will be removed at
        runtime).
        Hierarchy - (AudioManager)

6.  Scriptable Objects
        Used in ScriptableAudioManager.cs scriptable object to hold default sound effect files. To allow
        the restoration of default sounds during runtime when file sounds have been changed. A 
        way this is useful for development is for comparison of new sounds to old sounds when looking
        to replace sound effects (during runtime within the editor).
        Asset -  (Assets/ScriptableAudioManager.asset)
        

7. UI Toolkit Custom Editor Window
        Used in custom window at Window->ResetAudioClipsToDefault. This window lists the default
        audio files and has a button to reset the audio clips to default. It works in conjunction
        with the ScriptableAudioManager. The ResetAudioClipsToDefault.cs script gets the default
        values from ScriptableAudioManager to display. Then when the button is pressed, it updates
        the AudioManager with the references to the default values. 
        Menu - (Window -> ResetAudioClipsToDefault)
